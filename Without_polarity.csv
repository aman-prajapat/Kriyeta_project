1,1,1,2,1,Rewa,"I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place."
2,1,2,1,1,Indore,"Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register."
3,1,1,2,1,Dewas,"Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings."
4,1,2,1,2,Khandwa,"The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes."
5,1,1,2,2,Indore,It's too bad the food is so damn generic.
6,1,1,1,3,Ujjain,First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!
7,1,2,1,2,Rewa,And then tragedy struck.
8,2,1,1,2,Betul,"Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries."
9,1,3,1,1,Khandwa,"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food."
10,2,2,1,2,Dewas,"The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined."
11,2,2,2,1,Ujjain,I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.
12,2,2,1,2,Khandwa,RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.
13,2,1,2,2,Dewas,I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
14,1,4,1,1,Mandsaur,The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
15,3,1,1,2,Bhopal,"The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless."
16,1,1,1,4,Gwalior,Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.
17,1,1,3,3,Gwalior,Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.
18,2,3,1,2,Indore,I've never been treated so bad.
19,1,2,1,4,Jabalpur,I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
20,1,1,3,3,Rewa,I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.
21,1,1,4,2,Khandwa,The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.
22,2,1,3,2,Rewa,"Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!"
23,1,3,1,3,Dewas,No complaints!
24,3,1,3,1,Khandwa,Omelets are to die for!
25,1,1,2,4,Dewas,The worst was the salmon sashimi.
26,2,1,4,1,Ujjain,The manager was the worst.
27,2,3,1,2,Betul,The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.
28,1,2,2,3,Jabalpur,2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !
29,4,1,2,1,Jabalpur,"Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas."
30,1,2,3,2,Jabalpur,"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table."
31,2,2,2,2,Indore,"The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor."
32,2,1,2,3,Ujjain,The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
33,1,3,1,3,Rewa,I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.
34,4,1,2,1,Bhopal,Left very frustrated.
35,2,2,2,2,Mandsaur,Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.
36,3,2,2,1,Mandsaur,I was so insulted.
37,1,2,1,4,Rewa,Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...
38,1,5,1,1,Khandwa,"It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad."
39,4,1,1,2,Betul,The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.
40,3,2,2,1,Bhopal,I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.
41,1,3,3,1,Ujjain,I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!
42,3,2,2,1,Khandwa,"Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back."
43,3,1,2,2,Indore,"My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing."
44,1,1,1,5,Dewas,"Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon."
45,3,2,3,1,Jabalpur,My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
46,2,1,1,5,Bhopal,"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."
47,1,4,2,2,Bhopal,He was terrible!
48,4,1,2,2,Indore,"I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location."
49,1,3,3,2,Bhopal,The selection of food was not the best.
50,1,2,3,3,Rewa,There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.
51,2,2,2,3,Rewa,When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.
52,2,1,2,4,Gwalior,This one is simply a disappointment.
53,1,2,3,3,Dewas,This is a disgrace.
54,1,1,4,3,Mandsaur,"In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience."
55,3,1,4,1,Gwalior,Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.
56,4,2,1,2,Bhopal,The food was terrible.
57,3,3,2,1,Betul,"For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed."
58,4,1,3,1,Jabalpur,"We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste."
59,2,3,2,2,Dewas,Everything was gross.
60,3,1,1,4,Dewas,The management is rude.
61,1,2,2,4,Gwalior,We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.
62,1,3,1,4,Betul,We waited for forty five minutes in vain.
63,2,3,2,2,Khandwa,TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.
64,1,1,3,4,Indore,"Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too."
65,2,3,2,2,Jabalpur,What a mistake that was!
66,4,1,3,1,Indore,By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.
67,5,1,2,1,Jabalpur,"This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas."
68,3,4,1,1,Mandsaur,The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.
69,3,1,2,3,Rewa,Food was really boring.
70,1,5,1,2,Indore,This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!
71,1,5,1,2,Dewas,I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.
72,1,2,2,4,Rewa,The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.
73,1,5,1,2,Bhopal,Service sucks.
74,2,3,2,2,Ujjain,The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.
75,1,4,2,2,Indore,Avoid at all cost!
76,3,1,1,4,Rewa,Crust is not good.
77,3,1,2,3,Khandwa,Soggy and not good.
78,3,3,2,1,Mandsaur,"It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign."
79,5,2,1,1,Gwalior,It was not good.
80,2,5,1,1,Jabalpur,There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
81,2,2,1,4,Dewas,"Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE."
82,3,2,2,2,Gwalior,Waiter was a jerk.
83,5,1,2,1,Ujjain,It was probably dirt.
84,2,1,5,1,Indore,At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.
85,2,1,5,1,Bhopal,Service stinks here!
86,3,3,1,3,Jabalpur,the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.
87,3,2,3,2,Indore,Nothing special.
88,1,4,3,2,Gwalior,"When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing."
89,2,2,1,5,Indore,"For service, I give them no stars."
90,1,1,3,5,Mandsaur,We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.
91,1,4,1,4,Dewas,Horrible - don't waste your time and money.
92,2,3,2,3,Gwalior,"(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold."
93,2,1,4,3,Gwalior,did not like at all.
94,5,2,1,2,Bhopal,I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.
95,2,5,2,1,Bhopal,very tough and very short on flavor!
96,3,1,2,4,Gwalior,But now I was completely grossed out.
97,3,1,5,1,Bhopal,The only downside is the service.
98,3,5,1,1,Gwalior,If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.
99,1,4,4,1,Betul,Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.
100,2,2,3,3,Mandsaur,"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense."
101,3,2,4,1,Dewas,"Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks."
102,3,1,1,5,Jabalpur,"I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food."
103,2,4,2,2,Indore,"I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water."
104,1,1,3,5,Rewa,The Burrittos Blah!
105,1,4,1,4,Gwalior,Which are small and not worth the price.
106,5,1,2,2,Dewas,I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.
107,3,3,3,1,Betul,"Strike 2, who wants to be rushed."
108,1,3,5,1,Jabalpur,"To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser."
109,2,2,1,5,Mandsaur,"This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed."
110,1,1,5,3,Indore,The warm beer didn't help.
111,1,4,1,4,Jabalpur,The service was meh.
112,1,2,3,4,Mandsaur,We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.
113,3,4,1,2,Jabalpur,"Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing."
114,2,2,1,5,Jabalpur,I had a seriously solid breakfast here.
115,2,2,2,4,Khandwa,The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.
116,1,4,2,3,Gwalior,I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
117,2,1,4,3,Dewas,There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.
118,4,3,2,1,Betul,I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.
119,2,3,1,4,Indore,Def coming back to bowl next time
120,5,2,2,1,Mandsaur,"Plus, it's only 8 bucks."
121,2,3,3,2,Rewa,This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
122,4,3,1,2,Gwalior,I won't be back.
123,4,1,2,3,Indore,The live music on Fridays totally blows.
124,2,1,5,2,Ujjain,WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
125,5,1,3,1,Dewas,Waitress was a little slow in service.
126,4,2,3,1,Gwalior,So they performed.
127,2,1,5,2,Indore,"I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry...mmmm!"
128,3,4,2,1,Rewa,"It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk."
129,1,5,2,2,Khandwa,"Will never, ever go back."
130,1,3,4,2,Ujjain,"OMG, the food was delicioso!"
131,3,3,2,2,Bhopal,The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.
132,5,1,2,2,Gwalior,I dont think I will be back for a very long time.
133,5,2,2,1,Mandsaur,I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.
134,5,2,2,1,Bhopal,I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.
135,3,2,2,3,Mandsaur,They dropped more than the ball.
136,1,3,1,5,Jabalpur,I will be back many times soon.
137,1,3,3,3,Mandsaur,It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.
138,5,3,1,1,Betul,CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.
139,3,5,1,1,Jabalpur,"If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it."
140,3,4,1,2,Mandsaur,"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."
141,1,2,2,5,Rewa,We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.
142,2,5,2,1,Rewa,(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)
143,1,2,5,2,Mandsaur,5 stars for the brick oven bread app!
144,3,4,1,3,Gwalior,Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)
145,5,3,2,1,Rewa,There is nothing authentic about this place.
146,2,5,1,3,Jabalpur,-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
147,1,2,4,4,Betul,Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.
148,2,4,2,3,Mandsaur,The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.
149,3,4,3,1,Ujjain,"The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected."
150,2,4,1,4,Indore,Now this dish was quite flavourful.
151,4,4,1,2,Dewas,"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."
152,1,1,5,4,Betul,The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.
153,2,4,2,3,Indore,Service was very prompt.
154,5,1,4,1,Indore,I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.
155,2,3,2,4,Betul,Would not go back.
156,5,4,1,1,Khandwa,Must have been an off night at this place.
157,4,1,3,3,Ujjain,"The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous."
158,2,4,1,4,Bhopal,"For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon."
159,1,1,4,5,Jabalpur,Won't go back.
160,2,2,4,3,Rewa,Extremely Tasty!
161,5,3,1,2,Indore,Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.
162,2,3,4,2,Bhopal,#NAME?
163,4,3,3,1,Gwalior,My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.
164,4,1,4,2,Khandwa,#NAME?
165,3,2,3,3,Indore,"The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!"
166,4,2,4,1,Ujjain,The service was a bit lacking.
167,4,2,4,1,Bhopal,"Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables."
168,2,3,2,4,Gwalior,They know how to make them here.
169,4,2,4,1,Jabalpur,I took back my money and got outta there.
170,3,2,2,4,Mandsaur,He deserves 5 stars.
171,5,2,2,2,Bhopal,Never again will I be dining at this place!
172,1,4,2,4,Betul,Bacon is hella salty.
173,4,1,5,1,Dewas,"Phenomenal food, service and ambiance."
174,1,2,5,3,Indore,All the bread is made in-house!
175,2,2,5,2,Khandwa,The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.
176,5,1,3,2,Bhopal,I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.
177,2,4,1,4,Mandsaur,You can't beat that.
178,2,1,4,4,Bhopal,Check it out.
179,1,5,4,1,Mandsaur,"This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant."
180,5,1,2,3,Indore,"At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy."
181,5,4,1,1,Mandsaur,Will go back next trip out.
182,2,2,2,5,Rewa,I never come again.
183,5,1,4,1,Khandwa,Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.
184,3,2,5,1,Khandwa,"I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00."
185,1,2,4,4,Gwalior,I think not again
186,1,5,1,4,Ujjain,"If you're not familiar, check it out."
187,5,2,1,3,Ujjain,I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.
188,1,5,1,4,Betul,The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.
189,3,1,4,3,Jabalpur,Food arrived quickly!
190,1,4,4,2,Rewa,The turkey and roast beef were bland.
191,5,2,2,2,Gwalior,This place has it!
192,2,4,1,4,Betul,I waited and waited.
193,2,3,4,2,Bhopal,I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
194,3,2,2,4,Dewas,Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.
195,4,4,2,1,Gwalior,Food was so gooodd.
196,4,3,1,3,Rewa,I wouldn't return.
197,4,4,2,1,Jabalpur,"This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things."
198,2,3,1,5,Jabalpur,This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!
199,3,5,2,1,Ujjain,Sauce was tasteless.
200,5,3,2,1,Dewas,Will not be back.
201,2,4,2,3,Gwalior,say bye bye to your tip lady!
202,4,1,1,5,Dewas,We'll never go again.
203,3,3,2,3,Gwalior,Will be back again!
204,3,1,5,2,Bhopal,I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.
205,1,5,2,3,Jabalpur,"Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!"
206,3,1,2,5,Rewa,The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.
207,2,4,1,4,Bhopal,This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.
208,5,2,3,1,Dewas,I give it 2 thumbs down
209,3,2,5,1,Rewa,The shrimp tender and moist.
210,2,2,3,4,Khandwa,The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.
211,4,2,1,4,Ujjain,"Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold."
212,1,3,4,3,Dewas,Crostini that came with the salad was stale.
213,4,1,2,5,Ujjain,The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.
214,5,2,1,4,Khandwa,Never going back.
215,2,1,4,5,Dewas,Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.
216,2,5,3,2,Rewa,She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.
217,3,2,2,5,Ujjain,We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.
218,5,4,1,2,Ujjain,I was seated immediately.
219,2,5,1,4,Dewas,"Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced."
220,3,3,1,5,Betul,Restaurant is always full but never a wait.
221,5,1,3,3,Betul,"The service was not up to par, either."
222,1,5,4,2,Betul,#NAME?
223,5,1,3,3,Dewas,"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace."
224,4,3,3,2,Jabalpur,"Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee."
225,3,4,2,3,Mandsaur,"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow."
226,2,3,2,5,Jabalpur,Just don't know why they were so slow.
227,4,2,2,4,Indore,"On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop."
228,5,1,4,2,Dewas,Don't do it!!!!
229,2,5,4,1,Betul,The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!
230,2,5,4,1,Gwalior,He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.
231,5,1,2,4,Rewa,First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.
232,3,2,2,5,Gwalior,Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!
233,2,5,4,1,Mandsaur,And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.
234,2,5,3,2,Rewa,Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).
235,3,3,5,1,Ujjain,Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.
236,1,3,3,5,Rewa,walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.
237,1,5,3,3,Betul,"I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho."
238,5,2,3,2,Rewa,It was pretty gross!
239,1,5,3,3,Rewa,"Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!"
240,2,4,5,1,Betul,"If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen."
241,4,2,1,5,Betul,Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.
242,4,1,2,5,Jabalpur,It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.
243,5,4,2,1,Rewa,We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.
244,2,2,3,5,Bhopal,"This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment."
245,5,1,5,1,Mandsaur,It is worth the drive.
246,2,4,4,2,Jabalpur,"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas."
247,5,4,1,2,Rewa,"We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night."
248,3,2,2,5,Khandwa,The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
249,5,1,1,5,Jabalpur,The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
250,1,5,4,2,Gwalior,Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.
251,4,2,4,2,Ujjain,Highly recommended.
252,4,5,2,1,Ujjain,I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.
253,3,4,2,3,Betul,Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.
254,3,1,3,5,Indore,The service here leaves a lot to be desired.
255,1,2,4,5,Betul,I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.
256,5,4,1,2,Bhopal,My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.
257,2,4,4,2,Jabalpur,It's worth driving up from Tucson!
258,1,2,5,4,Rewa,This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.
259,3,5,2,2,Indore,This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.
260,1,1,5,5,Betul,Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.
261,3,5,1,3,Dewas,"Seriously flavorful delights, folks."
262,2,3,2,5,Mandsaur,Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.
263,3,4,4,1,Gwalior,Don't waste your time here.
264,1,4,5,2,Indore,Food was really good and I got full petty fast.
265,3,5,2,2,Jabalpur,If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!
266,3,1,5,3,Khandwa,The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.
267,4,4,2,2,Jabalpur,Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
268,4,3,3,2,Bhopal,"Overall, I like this place a lot."
269,2,2,5,3,Ujjain,"As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return."

275,3,1,4,5,Ujjain,The portion was huge!
276,3,5,3,2,Rewa,We'd definitely go back here again.
277,1,5,2,5,Jabalpur,The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.
278,4,3,1,5,Khandwa,definitely will come back here again.
279,2,3,4,4,Jabalpur,Everyone is treated equally special.
280,3,4,5,1,Bhopal,I'll definitely be in soon again.

290,4,3,1,5,Indore,Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.
